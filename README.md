# Chia Blockchain - The Definitive Guide

Chia Blockchain - The Definitive Guide is a book for developers, although the first two chapters cover chia at a level that is also approachable to non-programmers. Anyone with a basic understanding of technology can read the first two chapters to get a great understanding of chia.

This repository contains the complete outline to the book which began publishing in August 2022 and the work in progress which is the rest of the book. It will be created online for all to see the process, but it is not done yet as of 2022-08-22. I will indicate here when the book is in a nearly final state.

# Attributions

Much of this publication is derived from Matering Bitcoin - Programming The Open Blockchain by Andreas M. Aneonopoulos(https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook); since bitcoin is the standard blockchain and that book is the standard reference it is my opinion that the outline, general blockchain explanations and the overall spirit of the publication could not be improved much so parts were repurposed for explaining chia and I made an attempt at transferring the spirit of open source and free experimentation to the chia specific concepts. Chia is in many ways an upgrade to bitcoin and the differences are great enough to warrent it own own text and guids. When relating to other blockchain projects most times it is bitcoin and the comparison is such that chia is simply newer and improved technology. You are encouraged to attain a copy of this greatand inspiring publication and master bitcoin concurrently with chia.
